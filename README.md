# Xdead

Welcome to the homepage of `Xdead`, which is a tool implemented in the paper "**Beyond a Joke: Dead Code Elimination Can Delete Live Code**" (Under Review)


Description of current published code:


* `bcov` is used to generate the CFG of binary
* `live_instrumenter` is used to instrument test program
* `test-main/pydot-test-main.py` is the main python script used to construct test programs and perform compiler testing
* `test-main/se-confirm-v3.py` is the main python script used to perform binary symbolic execution with `Angr`

**Please kindly note that we will provide a more detailed set-up tutorial and usage of `Xdead` if the paper fortunately gets accepted.**


### Notice: The final release will be published on https://github.com/haoxintu/Xdead.
